## Description

This is a generator that automatically generates a professional README file based on user inputs. README files are super important in any project and having a good documentation of everything is not only best practice but crucial in helping users understand your project. Many times, users will have to go online and find a template and wonder what to add in. This is especially the case for users who are new and are starting their career/building their portfolio. Hence, this project is built so users can easily generate their own README file for their projects. This project solves the problem of having to find a template online every time when one needs to create a README file. It improves efficiency and saves time as this is something that is needed for every project. It also is a great starting point for any projects, allowing for expansions after. 

## Installation

To install/use this project, please clone this project first. After, in your command line, please run "node index.js". The command line will then provide prompts that user can answer in order to create this README file. Once all questions are answered, a README file will be generated and can be modified if needed.

## Usage

Users can use this project to help them create a quick and professional README profile. In this project, they will be prompted for the title, description, installation, usage, contributions, tests, Github username, and email address. User will be able to provide their response. User will also be asked which license to add for the project. User will be able to choose from a list. Once all questions are answered, a README file will be generated with the corresponding responses. A badge for the license will also be generated and added to the top of the README file. After the file is generated, the user can freely modify anything on the file as they wish. In the README file, there will now be a table of contents that will quickly bring users to what they need to see. If they would like to add/remove sections, they are able to do so. This merely provides a guideline to what should be added to a README file. 

To see the project in action, please refer to the visuals in the next section.
